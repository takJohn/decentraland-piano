Here's a quick [video](https://vimeo.com/288196835) showing the piano in action.

## Previewing the scene

Download and install the Decentraland CLI - please read this [installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/getting-started/installation-guide/) for further details.

```
npm i -g decentraland

```

Change to the directory of the cloned repository.

```
